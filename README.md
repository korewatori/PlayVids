## Playvids Video Downloader

### How to use
Run .EXE and enter a URL of a video. (At the moment, only one URL is supported.)   

### Current Features
- Downloads one video at a time (per instance) in the highest resolution available and outputs to a .TS file.

### Planned Features (in no particular order)
- Add help message
- Add support for subtitles
- Tags and metadata
- Add ffmpeg conversion support, with prompts after the user downloads a video
- Add command line support

I'm unsure whether I'll keep this as a Playvids Downloader fork because I might as well add support for other sites too, not necessarily porn.
